    <p>Turkic World Mathematical Society (TWMS) Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics was founded in 2010 by Turkic World Mathematical Society and Institute of Applied Mathematics of Baku State University. TWMS was founded in 1999 and unites mathematicians from Turkey, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Iran, China, USA and European countries. The creation of TWMS played an important role in the consolidation of the scientists’ potential and research centers of the Turkic world working in this field. The establishment of the journal “TWMS Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics” is an important practical step of such consolidation, as it provides new opportunities for the publication of the best achievements of scientists and mathematicians of Turkic countries, increasing of their recognition in the world of science and close cooperation with the International scientific community. This semiannually Journal publishes high-quality peer-reviewed research papers on the broad range of applied and computational mathematics.</p>
